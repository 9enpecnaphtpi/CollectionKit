The test booklet consists of the following components:
 
- An entry test to check the students' level and placement.
- Tests for each file (unit) of the coursebook, in A and B versions. Each test covers grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, reading, writing, listening and speaking skills.
- An extended end-of-course test, in A and B versions, to evaluate the students' overall achievement and readiness for the next level.
- A key with answers and transcripts for all the tests.

The tests are based on the topics, language items, and skills presented in the coursebook. They are graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) levels. The tests are suitable for both classroom use and self-study. They can help the students monitor their progress, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and prepare for exams.
 
New English File Elementary Test Booklet With Key is a useful resource for teachers and students who want to make the most of the New English File Elementary course. It provides a comprehensive assessment of the students' language abilities and helps them improve their confidence and competence in English.

One of the features of the test booklet is that it offers two versions of each test: A and B. This allows the teacher to administer the tests to different groups of students or to use them as a pre-test and a post-test. The A and B versions have the same level of difficulty and cover the same language items and skills, but they have different questions and tasks. This prevents the students from copying or memorizing the answers.
 
Another feature of the test booklet is that it includes a variety of test formats and tasks. The tests include multiple-choice questions, gap-fills, matching exercises, word puzzles, sentence transformations, writing tasks, dialogues, interviews, and role-plays. The tests aim to assess not only the students' knowledge of grammar and vocabulary, but also their ability to use the language in communicative situations. The tests also reflect the style and content of some international exams, such as KET and PET.
 
New English File Elementary Test Booklet With Key is a valuable tool for both teachers and students who want to measure their progress and achievement in English. It provides reliable and valid feedback on the students' language performance and helps them develop their skills further.
